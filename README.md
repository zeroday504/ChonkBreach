## Why ChonkBreach?
breachforums[.]is requires an account in order to search its forums. If you don't want to do that, this tool will offer an option to query the database leak forums for specific keywords in the thread titles. As an incident responder, this tool could offer some visibility on whether or not your organization has been compromised or affected. As a researcher, maybe you want to track trends.
